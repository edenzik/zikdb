ZiKDB
=====

- Make the file system an actual database
    - Fully embedded, literally a directory to run SQL on (like sqlite but for files)
    - Let's say... no hidden files? No hidden metadata? To insert simply add a file!
- Every file is a tuple
    - Extended file attributes are "attributes" (columns)
    - The file has actual content, like photos
    - Directory hierarchy is index (primary index)
    - Means a single primary key
- A query returns a set of file descriptors <FD> 
    - "Standard" SQL
    - Schema is top level of directory
    - Table is level under
    - Everything under are leaves in the index
    - SELECT * FROM schema.table WHERE x=5 just returns a bunch of paths
